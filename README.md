# CatalogHelper
A simple iOS app to theme asset catalogs with custom PNG icons

## Disclaimer
Asset catalogs are dangerous! If you mess one up, you'll bootloop.
While this tool is known to accurately and safely modify asset catalogs, I take no responsibility for any damages caused by this tool.

## Usage
**With SkadzThemer**

If you're an average user, you're probably here because of SkadzThemer. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/skadz108/CatalogHelper/releases/latest) and follow the steps on the SkadzThemer README.

**Advanced usage**

If you're not the average user, and you want to theme catalogs for research/testing purposes, you can probably figure out what the buttons do.
However, if you're really confused with `Import asset catalog` and/or `Theme asset catalog`, please forget this project exists.
